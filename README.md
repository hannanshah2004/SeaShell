# SeaShell

SeaShell is a lightweight shell implementation offering a user-friendly command-line interface. SeaShell supports standard shell functionalities, such as command execution and background process handling. It features an enhanced 'cd' command, allowing users to navigate both forward and backward through directories with a built-in history feature. The program utilizes fork and execvp for command execution, incorporates signal handling to log child process terminations, and maintains a directory history for efficient navigation. SeaShell serves as a foundational structure for a practical and user-centric command-line environment, blending simplicity with functionality for a seamless interactive experience.
